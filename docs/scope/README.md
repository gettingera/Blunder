# Scope Statement

## Initial Scope Statement
The scope of this project is to create a working raytracer with a graphical user interface (GUI).  
Elements that are beyond the scope of this project and will NOT be included are: 
- Animations 
- A graphical processing unit (GPU)

## Rescaled Scope Statement
The scope of this project is to create Blunder, a raytracer tool that uses spheres. Raytracing is defined as shooting rays from a camera and then coloring based on whether the spheres are hit by the rays. The spheres will be rendered using raytracing. Due to the time limit for this project’s development and testing, some features simply aren’t feasible to be implemented in Blunder. These items include optimization logic, a material system, and a graphical user interface (GUI).
