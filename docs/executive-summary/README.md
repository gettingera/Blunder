# Executive Summary

The problem that has been identified is that Blender, a vastly complex system, is far too complicated to be used as a reliable graphic graphics technique. Therefore, there is a need to develop an easy-to-use raytracer. We will combat this issue by using C++ to develop a new raytracer. This proposed solution will include a graphical user interface (GUI). Some of the security concerns with this project include ensuring all functions are maintainable and readable, following good coding standards and practices, and confirming that all code passes every unit test to validate outcomes are created as desired. Finally, the documentation lead team member will write up and finalize documentation for the project both physically and in the GitHub repository.
