# Executive Summary

## Initial Executive Summary
The problem that has been identified is that Blender, a vastly complex system, is far too complicated to be used as a reliable graphic graphics technique. Therefore, there is a need to develop an easy-to-use raytracer. We will combat this issue by using C++ to develop a new raytracer. This proposed solution will include a graphical user interface (GUI). Some of the security concerns with this project include ensuring all functions are maintainable and readable, following good coding standards and practices, and confirming that all code passes every unit test to validate outcomes are created as desired. Finally, the documentation lead team member will write up and finalize documentation for the project both physically and in the GitHub repository. 

## Rescaled Executive Summary
Currently, there is no software that just renders spheres. We aim to change that by making a program that does render spheres. What if a video game developer wishes to create a spherical Minecraft-esque game? This is just one of the many examples where our new spherical raytracer, Blunder, will fulfill the needs of users. We will do this using raytracing to make spheres. The result of this project will deliver a working, basic raytracer for use by users to create spherical objects.
