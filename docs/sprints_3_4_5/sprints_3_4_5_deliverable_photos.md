# Deliverable Photos

An example of the Code Lead's programming environment is shown below to generate an idea of how Blunder was created from a user perspective:

Upon starting the Blunder program, its rendering status is updated in real time to show its progress:

After the program finishes rendering, a file named “render.ppm” is created to display the outcome. Two example deliverables are shown below:
